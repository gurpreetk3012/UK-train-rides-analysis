# UK-train-rides-analysis

This project focuses on analyzing UK train rides to uncover insights into passenger behavior, travel demand patterns, revenue distribution, and operational performance. A comprehensive interactive dashboard was built to empower stakeholders such as transport authorities, railway operators, and business analysts to make data-driven decisions for service optimization and customer experience improvement.

The dashboard effectively answers critical business questions, such as:
- What are the most popular train routes?
- When are the peak travel times across the network?
- How does revenue vary by ticket types and travel classes?
- What is the on-time performance, and what factors contribute to delays?

## Popular Routes
The busiest train corridors highlight strong demand between major urban centers:

Manchester Piccadilly ↔ Liverpool Lime Street

London Euston ↔ Birmingham New Street

London Kings Cross ↔ York

London Paddington ↔ Reading

London St Pancras ↔ Birmingham New Street

- **Morning:** 6:15 AM, 6:30 AM, 7:30 AM – 8:00 AM
